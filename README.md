## Vision
Turning the world’s conversations into data

## Overview
There is almost no data of real-life conversations on the internet. This means speech-AI training data is drastically scarcer than text—something we have verified empirically. oto is a project that pairs a wearable voice-capture device with a smartphone app to turn daily conversations around the world into structured data. For speakers of major languages, oto unlocks personalized services—automatic task management, meeting notes, health insights. For under-represented languages and heavy accents, users can monetize their uploads by licensing data to AI firms. These incentives let us map global conversation flow, creating a speech-based Google Trends or Maps.
